      <p>A dish originating from Central Asia during the Han dynasty, fried rice is a staple dish in many households around the world.</p>
      <p>While today we primarily use chicken and vegetables, fried rice originally contained muxu (also known as alfalfa), giving it the name "muxufan"</p>
      <p>What happened after that is up for debate, but most people DO agree that if you have leftover vegetables and rice -- fried rice is the go-to dish.</p>
      <p>containing mostly vegetables and a pinch of protein, fried rice is also IBS friendly -- and delicious too! </p> 
    <h3>Ingedients</h3>
       <ul>
          <li>2/3 cup gluten free flour</li>
          <li>1 1/2 tsp backing powder</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
          <li>2 sticks unsalted butter -- use microwave to partially melt</li>
          <li>10 oz dark chocolate -- the higher cocoa % the better</li>
          <li>4 oz unsweetened chocolate chips</li>
          <li>1 cup sugar</li>
          <li>3 large eggs</li>
          <li>1 1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
          <li>1/2 cup nuts -- pecans or walnuts work best/li>
       </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol start="1">
          <li>Preheat oven to 375F. Line baking pan with parchment paper (We like 13 x 9!).</li>
          <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in large mixing bowl.</li>
          <li>Combine butter and dark chocolate in a medium bowl. Microwave until melted.</li>
          <li>In another large bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, and vanilla. Add chocolate & butter mix.</li> 
          <li>Fold in the dry mixture until flour is well-integreted. Fold in chocolate chips after.</li>
          <li>Pour batter into pan -- sprinkling nuts on top.</li>
          <li>Bake for 25 minutes, then check if done using a toothpick (or butterknife, if you're like us).</li>
          <li>When toothpick comes out clean, brownies are done. Cool for 5-10 minutes, cut, and enjoy! </li>
