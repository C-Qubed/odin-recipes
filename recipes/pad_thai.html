    <h3>Steps</h3>

          <li>In a small bowl, whisk soy sauce, maple syrup, peanut butter, lime juice, and fish sauce.</li>
          <li>Boil water and add rice noodles -- 4 minutes for al dente, longer to taste.</li>
          <li>In a wok (or a large pan), heat 1 tbsp of garlic infused oil on medium-high heat and add chicken. Cook chicken until seared, turning occasionally.</li>
          <li>Turn heat to medium. Add whisked egg, tossing the chicken around so that is coated in the egg. Cook for 5-6 minutes (or until chicken is done)</li>
          <li>Remove chicken and egg from pan and put aside. Heat remaining oil along with ginger and chili until fragrant.</li>
          <li>Add zucchini & carrot noodles. Add bean sprouts. Toss together.</li>
          <li>Re-add chicken and egg to pan. Add rice noodles on top. Toss vigousouly with wok -- two forks are helpful if noodles are clumped to create space.</li>
          <li>Pour the sauce mixture over the mix. Stir through. Add green onion and cilantro on top.</li>
          <li>Serve with extra bean sprouts, crushed peanuts, and lime slices on the side.</li>
