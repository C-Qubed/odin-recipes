      <p>A dish originating from Central Asia during the Han dynasty, fried rice is a staple dish in many households around the world.</p>
      <p>While today we primarily use chicken and vegetables, fried rice originally contained muxu (also known as alfalfa), giving it the name "muxufan"</p>
      <p>What happened after that is up for debate, but most people DO agree that if you have leftover vegetables and rice -- fried rice is the go-to dish.</p>
      <p>containing mostly vegetables and a pinch of protein, fried rice is also IBS friendly -- and delicious too! </p> 
    <h3>Ingedients</h3>
       <ul>
          <li>1-2 tablespoons butter (you can use vegetable oil if butter triggers your IBS!)</li>
          <li>1-2 tablespoons garlic infused olive oil (to taste)</li>
          <li>1 inch knob of ginger, finely diced</li>
          <li>1 chilli, finely sliced</li>
          <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce (or more to taste)</li>
          <li>2 tsp oyster sauce</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil</li>
          <li>2 large eggs, whisked</li>
          <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and diced</li>
          <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
          <li>1/2 bunch of green onions, green section only</li>
          <li>2 chicken breasts, cubed (or tofu, if vegetarian)</li>
          <li>4 cups cooked rice -- preferrably at least a day old</li>
          <li>Any other vegetables you have lying around the fridge!</li>
       </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol start="1">
          <li>Heat 1/2 of either butter or garlic oil in large wok over medium heat.</li>
          <li>Add egg -- cook until scrambled. Break up into very small places. Remove to seperate plate.</li>
          <li>Add remaining butter or garlic oil to wok. Add ginger and chili -- cook until fragrant. 
          <li>Saute for ~ 6 minutes (or until veggies have some give)</li> 
          <li>Add rice and green onions on top of veggies. Pour some of soy and oyster sauce over rice to help break up clumps. Pour remainder around the edge.</li>
          <li>Fry the rice for 4-5 minutes -- make sure to let the rice rest a bit to get nice and crispy, but don't burn it!</li>
          <li>When rice is cooked to your liking, add eggs and mix.</li>
          <li>Remove from heat and add sesame oil -- mix gently. </li>
